# Pre-Deployment Security Checklist for AI-Assisted Code

<!--
  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Complete this checklist before deploying any code that was generated or modified with AI agent assistance
  2. Every item must be marked Pass, Fail, or N/A with justification
  3. All Fail items must be resolved before deployment to production
  4. Retain completed checklists as part of your deployment records
  5. The reviewer completing this checklist MUST NOT be the same person who directed the agent

  Based on: Agentic Coding Playbook v0.4.0
  Aligned with: NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5.2, OWASP Top 10 for LLM/Agentic Applications
